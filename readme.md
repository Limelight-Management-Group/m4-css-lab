# CSS Positioning Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work with a partner, and build your own version of Instagram.com.  Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Use display, clear, and floats to position elements on the page
- Look up and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - the iPhone
  - App Store and Google Play buttons
  - Instagram Logo
  - Login button

**Bonus:**
- Make it even better than Instagram! Throw in some animations, experiment with `hover`, make it fun.

#### Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `main.css`

#### Deliverable

Please take a screenshot of your results and share them in Slack! They should look something like this:

### Self Evaluation

During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
- **Self-compassion:** Do you make productive use of turning failures into learning opportunities?
- **Resourcefulness:** Do make an effort to compare and contrast new ideas with ones you already know?
